This was my first solo project from Scrimba.com. The platform does not provide any code for the solo projects--not even after the project is completed. The student has to problem solve and use the skills and knowlege taught in the lessons to workout how to create the solo project. I used learned knowledge, documentation, web searches and the scrimba and stack overflow community to help me create this project. 

Students have the option of submitting their solo projects to the Scrimba discord community for peer code reviews.
